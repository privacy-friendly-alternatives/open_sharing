# open_sharing
  A block of services that allow privately hosted social sharing

# Some notes about the goal of this project
  The project should allow self hosting of a social share program.
  Individuals and groups can host an open share server and use it to
  exchange media between members.  Open share will also have methods
  used to exchange media between associated members of other open share
  servers.  The users will have different tiers of connections between
  members.  Essentially Friends and Family, Associates, and Communities.
  Friends and Family are intended to be the most intimate group where the
  majority of the content posted will be shared.  Associates is a more
  broad group where only some posted content will be shared.  Perhaps
  even tags will be implemented to make sharing with a specified group
  easily facilitated.  Communities are the highest tier of connection
  and the only one where it is possible to communicate with someone
  who is not someone who is known to you.  This is the closest to
  public that you can get.  posting to a community is the least secure
  but also the most secure we can get without making posts totally public.
